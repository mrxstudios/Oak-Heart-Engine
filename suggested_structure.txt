in each file and directory in your project structure:

main.cpp: This is the entry point of your application. It likely contains the main function where the execution of your game starts. It might set up the game loop, create the necessary engine components, and handle user input.

Engine/Engine.cpp and Engine/Engine.h: These files could contain the implementation and header for your game engine class. The engine class might manage the game loop, handle initialization and shutdown procedures, coordinate different subsystems like rendering, physics, audio, and more.

GameState/GameState.cpp and GameState/GameState.h: These files might define a game state class that represents a specific state or level in your game. It could handle updating and rendering the objects within that state.

Player/Player.cpp and Player/Player.h: These files could define the player class. It might contain properties and methods related to the player character, such as movement controls, health, inventory, etc.

Entity/Entity.cpp and Entity/Entity.h: This directory might contain base classes or interfaces for game entities. Entities could include any object in your game world, like enemies, collectibles, obstacles, etc.

Physics/PhysicsSystem.cpp and Physics/PhysicsSystem.h: These files might define the physics system responsible for simulating physics interactions in your game, like collisions, forces, and movements.

Input/InputManager.cpp and Input/InputManager.h: These files could define an input manager that handles user input, like keyboard, mouse, or controller events.

Rendering/Renderer.cpp and Rendering/Renderer.h: These files might implement a renderer class responsible for rendering graphics to the screen using graphics APIs like OpenGL or DirectX.

Audio/AudioManager.cpp and Audio/AudioManager.h: These files could define an audio manager class that handles playing sounds and music in your game.

UI/UIManager.cpp and UI/UIManager.h: These files might define a UI manager that handles the user interface elements and interactions.

Scripting/ScriptingManager.cpp and Scripting/ScriptingManager.h: These files could define a scripting manager that allows you to integrate scripting languages into your game for modding or custom behaviors.

Logic/GameLogic.cpp and Logic/GameLogic.h: These files might define the core game logic, including the game rules, objectives, and interactions between different components.

Save/SaveSystem.cpp and Save/SaveSystem.h: These files could define a save system responsible for saving and loading the game state to/from files.

assets/textures/: This directory would likely contain image files used as textures in your game.

assets/sounds/: This directory could contain sound files used for audio effects and music.

CMakeLists.txt: This file is used by CMake to configure and generate the build files for your project, including setting up the project name, defining source files, specifying include directories, linking libraries, and more.
